# Code-Quiz

## Description 

This project utilizes DOM manipulation, client-side storage, and javascript fundamentals with arrays and sorting. The project is a JavaScript multiple-choice quiz that generates a score that can be saved to local storage with the highest score listed first. 

The code incorporates event delegation on dynamically created HTML elements and navigating the JavaScript quiz object with questions and answers. The quiz is managed by a JavaScript interval function that displays a countdown timer and will inform the user when the quiz is done.
